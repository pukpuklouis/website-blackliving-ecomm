It enables administrators and editors to create, manage, and publish accessory products (such as mattress protectors, pillow sets, and bedding accessories) with full variant support, batch operations, and approval workflows. The implementation maintains minimal changes to existing schema while adding new functionality for accessory products.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports Black Living's mission to provide Taiwanese consumers with a seamless, trustworthy online shopping experience for home furnishings. By expanding product management capabilities to include accessories, we enable the platform to offer complete bedding solutions, increasing customer satisfaction and purchase value. The feature aligns with our commitment to quality, transparency, and operational excellence by providing robust administrative tools while maintaining data integrity and user experience standards.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Product Type Templates\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create products using predefined templates for different accessory types, so that I can efficiently manage various bedding accessories with appropriate variant options.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an admin selects a product type (mattress, protector, sheet-set, pillow, duvet, topper, adjustable-base, other) THEN the system SHALL display appropriate variant axes and default options\n2. WHEN creating a mattress product THEN the system SHALL provide firmness (extra firm, firm, medium, plush) and size (twinxl, full, queen, king, calking) axes\n3. WHEN creating a protector product THEN the system SHALL provide size axis only\n4. WHEN creating a sheet-set product THEN the system SHALL provide size and color axes\n5. WHEN creating a pillow product THEN the system SHALL provide firmness/loft axis\n6. WHEN creating a duvet product THEN the system SHALL provide size and weight axes\n7. WHEN creating a topper product THEN the system SHALL provide size and thickness axes\n8. WHEN creating an adjustable-base product THEN the system SHALL provide size axis\n9. WHEN selecting \"other\" product type THEN the system SHALL allow custom option definition\n\n### Requirement 2: Features Markdown Support\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create rich product feature descriptions using Markdown, so that I can provide detailed, formatted product information to customers.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN editing product features THEN the system SHALL provide a Markdown editor with support for text, images, and formatting\n2. WHEN featuresMarkdown is populated THEN the system SHALL display the Markdown content on product detail pages\n3. WHEN featuresMarkdown is empty THEN the system SHALL fallback to displaying the existing features array as a bulleted list\n4. WHEN saving product data THEN the system SHALL store both featuresMarkdown and maintain backward compatibility with features array\n\n### Requirement 3: Dedicated Product Edit Page\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want a dedicated product edit page instead of modal-based editing, so that I can efficiently manage complex product configurations with better user experience.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN clicking \"Edit\" on a product in the list THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/dashboard/products/{id}/edit`\n2. WHEN creating a new product THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/dashboard/products/new`\n3. WHEN on the edit page THEN the system SHALL display organized sections: Basic Info, Media, Specifications, Features, Advanced Settings\n4. WHEN using the features section THEN the system SHALL provide a BlockNote editor for Markdown content\n5. WHEN leaving the page with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog\n6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL auto-save drafts to localStorage\n\n### Requirement 4: Variant Matrix Generation\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want to automatically generate product variants from selected options, so that I can efficiently create all possible product combinations.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN selecting option values THEN the system SHALL generate a matrix of all possible variant combinations\n2. WHEN generating variants THEN the system SHALL allow admins to deselect unwanted combinations\n3. WHEN a variant is active THEN the system SHALL require price and stock values\n4. WHEN generating variants THEN the system SHALL auto-generate SKUs following the pattern: {category}-{series}-{dimensions}-{attributes}\n\n### Requirement 5: Batch Operations\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want to perform batch operations on multiple variants, so that I can efficiently update pricing, inventory, and images across similar products.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN selecting multiple variants THEN the system SHALL show batch operation toolbar\n2. WHEN performing batch pricing THEN the system SHALL support base price + differential pricing by option values\n3. WHEN performing batch inventory THEN the system SHALL support setting stock levels with \"same value\" or \"add to existing\" modes\n4. WHEN performing batch image assignment THEN the system SHALL allow assigning images by color or style options\n5. WHEN performing batch operations THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on affected variants\n\n### Requirement 6: SKU and Barcode Management\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want automatic SKU generation and optional barcode support, so that I can maintain consistent product identification across the system.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN generating variants THEN the system SHALL auto-create SKUs using the format: {CATEGORY}-{SERIES}-{SIZE}-{COLOR/WEIGHT}\n2. WHEN entering custom SKUs THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness across all products\n3. WHEN entering barcodes THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness (optional field)\n4. WHEN importing products THEN the system SHALL validate SKU uniqueness and reject duplicates\n\n### Requirement 7: Approval Workflow\n\n**User Story:** As an editor, I want a structured approval process for product publishing, so that quality standards are maintained while enabling efficient content creation.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an editor creates or edits a product THEN the system SHALL set status to \"draft\"\n2. WHEN submitting for review THEN the system SHALL change status to \"in_review\"\n3. WHEN an admin approves THEN the system SHALL change status to \"published\"\n4. WHEN publishing THEN the system SHALL validate required fields: main image, at least one active variant, valid prices and stock\n5. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL log the action with user, timestamp, and field changes\n\n### Requirement 8: CSV Import/Export\n\n**User Story:** As an admin, I want to bulk import and export product data via CSV, so that I can efficiently manage large product catalogs.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN exporting products THEN the system SHALL include columns: productId, productType, title, option:size, option:color, option:weight, sku, price, stock, barcode, imageUrl, status\n2. WHEN importing CSV THEN the system SHALL validate SKU uniqueness and reject invalid option combinations\n3. WHEN import fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with row numbers and issues\n4. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL support \"skip errors\" mode to import valid rows while reporting issues\n\n### Requirement 9: Role-Based Permissions\n\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want granular permissions for product management, so that different user roles have appropriate access levels.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user has Admin role THEN the system SHALL allow full CRUD operations and publishing\n2. WHEN a user has Editor role THEN the system SHALL allow create/edit operations but require admin approval for publishing\n3. WHEN a user has Viewer role THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access to product data\n4. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and hide restricted UI elements\n\n### Requirement 10: API Endpoints\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive REST API endpoints, so that I can build rich product management interfaces.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
