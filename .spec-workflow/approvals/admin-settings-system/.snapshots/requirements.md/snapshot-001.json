This system will replace the current placeholder component and enable secure, auditable configuration management across the entire platform.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports Black Living's operational excellence objective by providing administrators with the tools needed to maintain 98% on-time delivery rates and achieve 4.8+ star customer satisfaction. The settings system enables efficient management of business-critical configurations without developer intervention, supporting the platform's goal of becoming the most trusted furniture e-commerce brand in Taiwan.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: User Permission Management\n\n**User Story:** As a Black Living administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions so that I can control access to different system functions and maintain security.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an admin accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL display a user permissions management section\n2. WHEN an admin views user permissions THEN the system SHALL show all current admin users with their roles (Super Admin, Admin, Editor, Viewer)\n3. WHEN an admin assigns a role to a user THEN the system SHALL validate the assignment and log the change with timestamp and admin attribution\n4. WHEN an admin removes admin privileges THEN the system SHALL require fresh session confirmation and audit logging\n5. IF a user attempts to access unauthorized settings THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security event\n\n### Requirement 2: Website Basic Settings Management\n\n**User Story:** As a Black Living administrator, I want to manage core website information so that customers see accurate and up-to-date business details.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an admin accesses website settings THEN the system SHALL display sections for site title, contact information, and business hours\n2. WHEN an admin updates the site title THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update both the admin interface and public website\n3. WHEN an admin modifies contact information THEN the system SHALL validate email format and phone number format\n4. WHEN an admin updates business hours THEN the system SHALL support multiple time slots and special holiday schedules\n5. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and cache invalidation for public site updates\n\n### Requirement 3: Payment & Logistics Settings Management\n\n**User Story:** As a Black Living administrator, I want to configure payment processing and shipping options so that the platform can handle transactions and deliveries efficiently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN an admin accesses payment settings THEN the system SHALL display secure forms for bank account configuration\n2. WHEN an admin configures bank accounts THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information and validate account formats\n3. WHEN an admin sets up shipping methods THEN the system SHALL support multiple carriers with pricing and delivery timeframes\n4. WHEN an admin configures payment gateways THEN the system SHALL support Taiwan payment providers with proper PCI compliance\n5. IF payment settings are modified THEN the system SHALL require fresh session confirmation and send notification alerts\n\n### Requirement 4: Settings Audit & Security\n\n**User Story:** As a Black Living administrator, I want all settings changes to be audited so that I can maintain accountability and security compliance.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN any setting is modified THEN the system SHALL log the change with user ID, timestamp, old value, and new value\n2. WHEN sensitive settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL require fresh session authentication\n3. WHEN settings are exported THEN the system SHALL provide secure, encrypted backup files\n4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and alert administrators\n5. WHEN settings are restored from backup THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and provide rollback capability\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each settings module shall handle one specific domain (permissions, website, payments)\n- **Modular Design**: Settings components shall be isolated and reusable across different admin interfaces\n- **Dependency Management**: Settings modules shall not have circular dependencies\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Settings APIs shall provide typed interfaces with validation schemas\n\n### Performance\n- Settings pages shall load within 2 seconds under normal network conditions\n- Settings updates shall take effect within 30 seconds across all system components\n- The system shall handle concurrent admin users without data conflicts\n- Settings caching shall reduce database load by 80% for read operations\n\n### Security\n- All settings changes shall be encrypted in transit and at rest\n- Sensitive payment information shall follow PCI DSS compliance standards\n- Role-based access control shall prevent unauthorized settings modifications\n- Audit logs shall be tamper-proof and retained for regulatory compliance periods\n\n### Reliability\n- Settings system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours\n- All settings changes shall support transactional rollback on failure\n- The system shall provide graceful degradation when external services are unavailable\n- Data validation shall prevent corrupted settings from being saved\n\n### Usability\n- Settings interface shall follow Black Living's design system and accessibility standards\n- Form validation shall provide clear, actionable error messages in Traditional Chinese\n- Settings shall be organized in logical groups with progressive disclosure for complex options\n- The system shall provide contextual help and validation feedback for all settings\n",
