This feature implements MeiliSearch as a dedicated search engine to provide fast, relevant, and scalable search capabilities across products, blog posts, and static pages, achieving sub-100ms response times and supporting typo-tolerant fuzzy search.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the product vision by providing exceptional user experience through fast, accurate search functionality that enables customers to quickly find products and content, improving conversion rates and user satisfaction. The implementation maintains the existing Cmd+K modal interface while dramatically improving backend performance.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: MeiliSearch Backend Integration\n\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the search backend to use MeiliSearch instead of D1 LIKE queries, so that search performance improves from seconds to milliseconds\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a search query is submitted THEN the system SHALL query MeiliSearch indexes instead of D1 database with LIKE operations\n2. IF MeiliSearch is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to basic D1 search functionality\n3. WHEN content is created/updated/deleted THEN the system SHALL automatically update the corresponding MeiliSearch index within 5 seconds\n4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include relevance scores and highlighted search terms\n\n### Requirement 2: Enhanced Search Features\n\n**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want fast, typo-tolerant search with autocomplete suggestions, so that I can quickly find products and content even with imperfect search terms\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I type in the search input THEN the system SHALL provide real-time autocomplete suggestions within 50ms\n2. IF I make a typo in my search query THEN the system SHALL return relevant results using fuzzy matching\n3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms in the results\n4. WHEN I search THEN the system SHALL return results from products, blog posts, and pages in a unified ranked list\n\n### Requirement 3: Faceted Search and Filtering\n\n**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to filter search results by category and type, so that I can narrow down results to find exactly what I'm looking for\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show filter options for content type (products, posts, pages)\n2. IF I select a filter THEN the system SHALL update results to show only matching content types\n3. WHEN I search for products THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category, price range, and availability\n4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state across pagination\n\n### Requirement 4: Search Analytics and Performance Monitoring\n\n**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track search usage and performance metrics, so that I can optimize the search experience based on user behavior\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN searches are performed THEN the system SHALL log query terms, result counts, and response times\n2. WHEN users click search results THEN the system SHALL track click-through rates by content type\n3. WHEN zero results are returned THEN the system SHALL log the query for analysis\n4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL expose search performance metrics via monitoring endpoints\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Search service, index management, and analytics shall be separate modules\n- **Modular Design**: MeiliSearch client shall be abstracted behind a clean interface for easy testing and replacement\n- **Dependency Management**: Search functionality shall not introduce circular dependencies between frontend and backend\n- **Clear Interfaces**: API contracts shall be well-defined with TypeScript interfaces\n\n### Performance\n- **Search Response Time**: 95th percentile response time shall be under 100ms\n- **Concurrent Users**: System shall support 100+ simultaneous search requests\n- **Index Update Latency**: Content changes shall be reflected in search within 5 seconds\n- **Memory Usage**: MeiliSearch instance shall use under 512MB memory\n- **Query Rate Limit**: 100 requests per minute per IP address to prevent abuse\n\n### Security\n- **API Authentication**: MeiliSearch shall use API key authentication\n- **Input Validation**: All search inputs shall be sanitized to prevent injection attacks\n- **Data Privacy**: Search queries shall not log personally identifiable information\n- **Access Control**: Search indexes shall only be accessible through authenticated API endpoints\n\n### Reliability\n- **Service Availability**: MeiliSearch service shall maintain 99.9% uptime\n- **Graceful Degradation**: System shall continue functioning with reduced search capabilities if MeiliSearch fails\n- **Data Consistency**: Search indexes shall remain synchronized with primary database\n- **Error Handling**: Failed index updates shall be retried with exponential backoff\n\n### Usability\n- **Keyboard Navigation**: Cmd+K and \"/\" shortcuts shall work consistently across browsers\n- **Loading States**: Search interface shall show loading indicators during queries\n- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages shall be displayed for failed searches\n- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Search modal shall work properly on mobile devices\n- **Accessibility**: Search interface shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards\n",
