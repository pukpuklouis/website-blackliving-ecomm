The feature adds thumbnail uploads via Cloudflare R2, focal point persistence in D1, and front-end rendering that respects the stored focus coordinates.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nPrecise thumbnail presentation supports Black Living’s premium brand story by ensuring editorial content, product highlights, and hero imagery stay visually balanced across devices without manual image editing.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to save thumbnail focal coordinates for each post so that the preview cards highlight the intended subject.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the composer PATCHes `/api/posts/:id/thumbnail-focal` with `thumbFocalX` or `thumbFocalY` outside 0..1 THEN the API SHALL respond with 400 and a validation error.\n2. IF the post ID does not exist THEN the API SHALL respond with 404 `{\"error\":\"not found\"}`.\n3. WHEN valid coordinates are saved THEN the API SHALL persist `thumb_focal_x`, `thumb_focal_y`, `thumb_render_mode` and update `updated_at`.\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to upload a thumbnail through the admin composer so that the file is stored securely in R2 with a public URL.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the composer POSTs `/api/uploads` without a `file` field THEN the API SHALL respond with 400 `{\"error\":\"file required\"}`.\n2. WHEN a valid file is posted THEN the API SHALL write it to R2 using `thumbnails/${timestamp}-${uuid}.${ext}` and respond with 200 including the object key and public URL.\n3. WHEN the upload succeeds THEN the admin SHALL persist the returned URL into `posts.thumbnail_url`.\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a shopper, I want blog cards to frame thumbnails around the stored focal point so that key subjects stay centered on every layout.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a post has `thumbnail_url` THEN the web card SHALL render the image with `object-position` derived from `(thumb_focal_x, thumb_focal_y)` and default to `50% 50%` if values are missing.\n2. WHEN a post lacks `thumbnail_url` THEN the card SHALL hide the image container or show the existing placeholder without errors.\n3. WHEN designers preview cards in 1:1, 4:3, or 16:9 wrappers THEN the rendered subject SHALL align with the chosen focal point.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Keep upload handling, focal persistence, and rendering concerns isolated across API, admin UI, and web layers.\n- **Modular Design**: Reuse shared packages (db schema, types, UI) instead of duplicating logic inside apps.\n- **Dependency Management**: Use existing Better Auth/Breadcrumb patterns; avoid introducing new storage libraries.\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Expose focal point props through typed interfaces between admin components and API calls.\n\n### Performance\n- Persist focal metadata alongside the existing `posts` row to avoid extra lookups; uploads must stream directly to R2 without buffering entire files in memory.\n\n### Security\n- All uploads route through the Worker API; enforce MIME checks and reject disallowed types; never expose R2 credentials to clients.\n\n### Reliability\n- Default focal values to 0.5/0.5 to keep legacy posts stable; ensure trigger updates `updated_at`; handle R2 or DB failures with surfaced errors.\n\n### Usability\n- Admin picker provides keyboard/mouse adjustments, reset, and numeric inputs with immediate visual feedback; front-end fallbacks prevent layout shifts on missing thumbnails.\n`\n",
